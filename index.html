  <h3>What Cultural Anthropologists Do</h3>
  <p>Cultural anthropologists study how people who share a common cultural system organize and shape the physical and social world around them, and are in turn shaped by those ideas, behaviors, and physical environments. Cultural anthropology is
    hallmarked by the concept of culture itself.</p>
  <h3>The Importance of Cultural Anthropology</h3>
  <p>Social anthropology plays a central role in an era when global understanding and recognition of diverse ways of seeing the world are of critical social, political and economic importance. Social anthropology uses practical methods to investigate
    philosophical problems about the nature of human life in society.</p>

  <h3>Today there are four main career paths for anthropology graduates:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Academic Careers; on campuses, in departments of anthropology, and in research laboratories, anthropologists teach and conduct research. They spend a great deal of time preparing for classes, writing lectures, grading papers, working with
      individual students, composing scholarly articles, and writing books. Academic Careers

    </li>
    <li>Corporate and Business Careers; many corporations look explicitly for anthropologists, recognizing the utility of their perspective on a corporate team. A corporate anthropologist working in market research might conduct targeted focus groups
      to examine consumer preference patterns not readily apparent through statistical or survey methods. These anthropologists use their research skills to talk to consumers and users of technology to find out how products and services could be
      improved to better meet the needs of consumers.</li>
    <li>Government Careers; state and local governmental organizations use anthropologists in planning, research and managerial capacities. Contract archaeology is a growing occupation with state and federal legislative mandates to assess cultural
      resources affected by government funded projects. Forensic anthropologists, in careers glamorized by Hollywood and popular novels, not only work with police departments to help identify mysterious or unknown remains but also work in university
      and museum settings. The federal government is one of the largest employers of anthropologists outside of academia. Possible career paths include: international development, cultural resource management, the legislative branch, forensic and
      physical anthropology, natural resource management, and defense and security sectors.</li>
    <li>Non-profit and Community-based Careers; non-governmental organizations, such as international health organizations and development banks employ anthropologists to help design and implement a wide variety of programs. However, these aren't the
      only opportunities available. Many anthropologists work in local, community-based settings for non-profit agencies. Sometimes, they work through community-based research organizations like the Institute for Community Research. Other times, they
      might work for established
      organizations in a community like the YMCA, local schools, or environmental organizations.</li>
  </ul>
